# Where Can My Robot Go?

**Hint: Where do robots find what pages are on a website? Hint 2: What does disallow tell a robot?**

Web robots or web crawlers move in a predetermined and automatic way across webpages. Each website has it's own "/robots.txt". The website's pages that web robots are prohibited from accessing are listed on this page. They instruct the robot not to go there.

We are going to go to the "*robots.txt*" of "ctflearn.com" -->  https://ctflearn.com/robots.txt
